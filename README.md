# Experimenting with Trotterization on a quantum computer

Exploring Hamiltonian simulations for various Hamiltonians on a quantum computer. Different Trotterization settings and the resulting error rates are compared. This code was created as part of my bachelor's thesis. 

Tested on: python=3.10.13, qiskit=1.4.2, qiskit_ibm_runtime=0.37.0, numpy=2.0.1
